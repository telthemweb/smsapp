## Intro
[SMS - Live APP](https://idrice24.github.io/School-Management-Software/)
<p>
The School Management System in Java Spring Boot is an application developed for schools. It is an application developed in Java Spring boot which store all the school related records. it stores information about student, staff and teachers. The DataBase used is MySQL. My objective of developing such a system its to reduce the errors that creep in the manual system where it was very difficult to store record.The whole System is managed by the administrator who has all the privilages to edit or modify any school member info. A student can view his/her details by logging with their details. It is easy to use and also secure.

 ## Architecture Overview
You can find the architecture overview [here](documents/architecture-overview.md), which will give ou a good starting point in how the backend services interact with other services, and purpose the serve.


## Documentation
The full documentation of this software can be found in the [sms-documentation](https://) repository. The documentation repository contains technical documents, architecture information, and whitepapers related to this implementation.

## Technologies (IDE) client/server
# Server Side
This project is based on the [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project use these packages :
- [Neteans IDE](https://netbeans.org/index.html)
    - Setting Up the Project
    - Adding Code to the Generated Source File
    - Compiling and Running the Application
    - Building and Deploying the Application
    - Next Steps
  To complete this tutorial, you need the following software and resources
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
    - Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
- [Spring Core](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
    - it is used to create stand-alone Spring applications and we embe Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc)
    -  it easier to build Spring powered applications that use data access technologies. Since it module deals with enhanced support of JDBC based data access layers
- [Spring MVC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_web_mvc_framework.htm)
    - THe MVC ( Model-View-Controller) is use to designe the architecture of web applications.
- [Thymleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
    - Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments. it help to design and deploy HTML on the browser.
- [JDK](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
    - Which stand for Java Development Kit, which help us to develop, text, protype, and demonstrate JAVA Apps.

## Development
The project is created with Maven, so you just need to import it to your IDE and build the project to resolve the dependencies
